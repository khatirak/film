# Project Name: Life Beneath the Campus

# Project Description:
Life Beneath the Campus is a film of the hidden world that lies beneath the vibrant exterior of a modern campus. The project’s concept centers on the juxtaposition of the bright, energetic campus above with the mysterious, shadowed underground realm below. Through an interactive website and short film, the aim was to create an immersive experience that gradually transitions the viewer—from the familiar, well-lit campus environment into the intriguing depths below—evoking feelings of curiosity, discovery, and a slight sense of unease.

# Process:
The implementation process began with a clear conceptual vision that emphasised a gradient-based visual narrative, symbolising a journey from light to dark. 
I developed the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on:
	•	Interactive Elements: Incorporating a photo carousel and an embedded YouTube video that mimic the dimensions and feel of a cinematic experience.
	•	Animated Text: Implementing staggered animations for textual content to create a dynamic and engaging storytelling rhythm.
